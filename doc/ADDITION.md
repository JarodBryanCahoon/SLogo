Estimation: before looking at the old code:
how long do you think it will take you to complete this new feature?
* I think it will take around 1 -1.5 hours to complete this new feature.
how many files will you need to add or update? Why?
* I think I will have to update maybe 5 or 6 files to add in this new feature. I would initially have to make new files for the new commands, and 
in addition would have to get the permission possible to actually add the stamp to the front end.
