CompSci 308 SLOGO Addition
===================

I plan on adding a feature to allow users to clear the screen through the menu on the authoring screen.
### Estimation
* I believe that it will take me less than 30 minutes to add this new feature
* I would have to only add a new Menu strategy and edit the Menu XML file to add this new feature.

### Review
* It took me about 20 munutes to complete this new feature
* I needed to add one class and update one XML file. This is because in adding a feature to the menu, I had to only add a new menu strategy, which was represented by the class I added. The XML file is reflected upon by the Menu classes, which reads the XML file and adds the menu items accordingly.
* It took only one try in order to add the menu item successfully.


### Analysis
* I feel that this exercise helped draw out the extensibility of the project's design. Most of the time I spent was mostly just to refamiliarize myself with out API. However, once this was done, the actual act of adding the feature was fairly simple.
* I feel that this could have been improved simply in its documentation. This project did not provide a clear JavaDoc, so the most I had to work with was the names of each method. While this was fine, it could have been a bit more streamlined.
*I feel like the proces would have been significantly slower, since I would have had no idea to use the XML file to add the menu item and to extend the MenuItemStrategy class. However, if I was provided with just that information, I feel that the process would not have been that much different.
