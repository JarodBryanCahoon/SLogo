Estimation: before looking at the old code:
how long do you think it will take you to complete this new feature?
* I think it will take around 1 -1.5 hours to complete this new feature.
how many files will you need to add or update? Why?
* I think I will have to update maybe 5 or 6 files to add in this new feature. I would initially have to make new files for the new commands, and 
in addition would have to get the permission possible to actually add the stamp to the front end.


Review: after completing the feature:
how long did it take you to complete this new feature?
	*Like one hour, and I am not sure that it even works (I can't check this)
how many files did you need to add or update? Why?
	*Around 10. I forgot what a tangled mess front end is to add stuff to and check.
did you get it completely right on the first try?
	*Nope. Still don't think that I do have it right
	
Analysis: what do you feel this exercise reveals about your project's design and documentation?
was it as good (or bad) as you remembered?
	* Uhh actually looking back it seems that the backend was better than I remembered, because I only had to
	add two or so classes to the backend for it to be "complete" in backend.
what could be improved?
	* The documentation on front end is horrible. I have absolutely no clue how to simply add an imageview (stamp)
	to the screen, and the documentation for front end does not the best job of explaining that. There is like a tangled net of observables 
	and stuff, and I can't seem to find a simple way to add stuff.
what would it have been like if you were not familiar with the code at all?
	* Yeah this would have been horrible. I probably would not have been able to navigate the backend either, because the only 
	reason I was easily able to pick off from where I was was because I remembered where I had left off previously. It would have taken a long time to 
	understand both the front end and the back end.
